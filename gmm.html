Another test is $x=2$ and $\int_Y x$ or \(x = +2 \)

The k-means clustering model is an unsupervised learning process used to identify ``clusters'' in the data. 

It's not really correct to call these "local minima", because 

Let's learn some properties of k-means clustering that weren't covered in Ng's course:

First, notice that if you have data points {x_1, \dots, x_n}, then
