Gaussian mixture models are an upgraded version of k-means clustering

The most naive algorithm would be to iterate through all the different possible 

The most popular algorithm to determine these clusters is an iterative proceduce that 



Another test is $x=2$ and \(\int_Y x \sum_{\textrm{partitions}}x^2\) or \(x = +2 \)


Where does it go wrong?

The k-means clustering model is an unsupervised learning process used to identify ``clusters'' in the data. 

It's not really correct to call these "local minima", because 

Let's learn some properties of k-means clustering that weren't covered in Ng's course:

First, notice that if you have data points {x_1, \dots, x_n}, then
