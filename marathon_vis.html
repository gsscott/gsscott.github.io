All the data from this page was collected from <a href="http://www.torontowaterfrontmarathon.com/wp-content/themes/crs/resultsmenu/results-menu-stwm.php"> this database </a> of finishing statistics for the Toronto Waterfront Marathon. I omitted all participants who did not finish or were disqualified.

<h3 class="subsection"> Finishing Time</h3>

The plot below shows the finishing times of participants of the Toronto Waterfront Marathon from 2002 to 2016. You can filter the results by age, year, and gender.

You can really see the big bump below the 3:00 mark, the 3:30 mark, and the 4:00 mark. These are goal times for many people, and large groups that are following pacers will appear as bumps here.

It's interesting to see that the median pace hasn't changed much over the years. I was expecting that as the popularity of the marathon grew, that the overall pace would decrease, but if this trend exists, it isn't very obvious in the data.


<h3 class="subsection"> Splits</h3>

The plot below compares the pace of the runners during different segments of the race to their average pace over the entire race. For example, the violin plot labelled '0-10km' measures the (pace for first 10k, (sec/km)) minus (entire race pace (sec/km)). The big bump around -8 means that a lot of people ran their first 10k at a pace roughly -8 seconds/km faster than their overall race pace. You can filter these results by age, gender, and finishing time. You can also change which segment you're comparing against by clicking on the title of the plot.

It's fun to watch how the faster runners tend to have much more even splits. However, they still have tend to start out a bit too fast, then get slower. I was actually surprised by how much 

A few warnings about this visualization:
<ul>
<li> The distance in the segment 40-42.2km is much shorter than the other distances. Because of this, for purely statistical reasons we'd expect there to be more variability in runners' paces over 40-42.2km than in the other segments -- even ignoring the fact that there are other psychological and physiological reasons people go abnormally fast or slow at the end of a marathon. So don't overanalyze the 40-42.2km segment, it's just there for fun!</li>
<li> There are problems with the 2012 data -- many runners are recorded as finishing the race before they hit the 40km checkpoint. I think this is an issue with the 40km checkpoint, so the plot above does not include the data from 2012 when visualizing any statistic that uses the 35-40km or 40km-42.2km paces.</li>
</ul>
